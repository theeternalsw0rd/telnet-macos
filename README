For those of us still running ancient networking gear.

This is a port of OpenBSD telnet initially ported for Suse Linux and reported for macOS High Sierra. The built-in client was discontinued.

Unlike the initial port, this package does not include telnetd.

I've been searching for the original OpenBSD source files to ensure any updates have been applied, but I cannot find them anywhere. If you know where they are, please file an issue.

The original package was pulled from Gentoo's distfiles as the original port at http://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/kukuk/ipv6/telnet-bsd-1.2.tar.bz2 now returns a 404.
